			We were doing laundry last night (April 9) and noticed that the washing machine drum was filling with brown water. When will Aqua get in touch with Springdale residents and let us know what the recurrent problem is? Once upon a time they said it was defective mineral filters.<br /><br />James L.

				Once again we have Aqua technicians out in Springdale fixing filters to remove iron from the water. We were not alerted by signs in the front entrances, or for those of us who are more homebound, by e-mail. We don't know when the water runs brown that it is a loss of a filter for minerals or whether there has been a breach in the decontaminated water supply,<br /><br /> I'm curious--where's the communication from Aqua?<br /><br /> If we are getting a flood of iron in multi-use water, is that truly safe? Be objective: check out various sites on the web for iron's effects on human and pet health. It can't be good for washing clothes due to staining. Feeding the bacteria in septic tanks with iron compounds may not be a good thing for their survival, and recharging the septic tank with new bacteria may be required after an iron overload.<br /><br />James L.

				Just an FYI about the brown water.  It ia actually IRON that is making the water brown/orange.  Aqua says it will not hurt you if you drink it.  They told us that it was caused by the filter system and that they have 3 filters doing the work of 4 until they get the other one in.  When chlorine is added to water with iron in it, it turns brown/orange and they had just installed a new barrel of chorline - This is usually done around the begining of each month and with the filter out,  it was really bad. This started 3 weeks ago- don't know why it takes so long for them to get replacement filters and they really couldn't answer that question.  I was told by the maintenance guy that they would give us a "1000 gallon credit" for flushing the system but when you call back to ask about it or get your bill with no credit they say there is no such thing as a credit for this even though they have been using our water to flush the system.  I will be calling them back on Monday.  I think we get it the worst here in Phase One since the pump house is so close to us.<br/><br/>Dave and Darlene Conner <strong>Posted 09/17/2012</strong>

				I received a reply from customer service indicating that Aqua had been investigating the source of the brown water. They think they have it taken care of, and offered to come out for another inspection if everything was not OK. Admittedly the water is not nearly as brown as it was. They claim the water can be drunk. <br/><br/>James Wilmer <strong>Posted 09/09/2012</strong>

				Over the past 4 days or so, we noticed that our drinking water has turned brown again. What is the contaminant this time around? Does anyone know what Aqua is doing to remedy the situation? I have written Aqua, but they reserve the right to get in touch in 24 hours. Should we be boiling our water?  About two weeks ago I noticed an Aqua water tanker leaving Springdale, followed by backhoe tractor on a flatbed truck. Shouldn't we be getting updates on activities involving our water supply?  <br/><br/>James Wilmer <strong>Posted 09/09/2012</strong>

				Nan & I went small appliance shopping the other day. Normally, we check out Kohl's because of their sales coupons. For awhile Kohl's in Kernersville was honoring their sale price, their coupon discount  and their senior discount all on one transaction! That was fantastic! We always thought it was one discount or the other, but, what did we know, and we weren't going to complain! However, the last time we went to their Kernersville store, they told us that we couldn't take all the discounts anymore and that it was one or the other. Oh well.  
				Last week we were in Winston-Salem looking for small electronic appliances and went to the Kohl's there. Before we started shopping, I asked about the discounts and they confirmed that it was either/or, but said that we could also use any "Kohl's Bucks" that we had. We looked at the merchandise and decided that, since there was a Bed, Bath and Beyond(B3) right next door, we would check their prices out before we bought anything. Boy am I glad we did. B3 usually sends out flyers with a 20% coupon per single item on the back. The coupon has an expiration date, but the cashiers will honor any that have expired, so don't throw them away. Kohl's will honor their expired Kohl's Bucks, too, but only in small denominations ($10, $20) at their discretion.
				We compared B3's prices with Kohl's and were stunned to find that B3 blew them away consistently on small appliances. Even when you added all the discounts in, B3's prices were significantly better on exactly the same brands and model #'s.
				Both stores were a pleasure to shop in - they had both been updated and upgraded and, appearance-wise, were light and airy. Kohl's generally had a larger selection of small appliances, but Bed, Bath and Beyond certainly had the better prices. <br><br>- Thanks, Tom McCoy <strong>Posted 2/27/2012</strong>

			<li>My wife and I just got fed up with the water quality and contacted Dr. John's H<sub>2</sub>0 for help with water filtration options.  They were very friendly and provided a quick turnaround once we knew what we wanted.  They have a representative named Jason Barnes who lives in Stokesdale.  I'm sure he'd be glad to provide more details should anyone want to discuss.  His email address is <a href="mailto:jbarnes@drjohnsh2o.com">jbarnes@drjohnsh2o.com</a>.  Also, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:briandavis1977@gmail.com">me</a> if anyone wants more information on our experience.  Thanks. - <strong>Posted 12/27/2011</strong></li>
